# 🚀 Qubic Proposal Viewer: Breaking Language Barriers in Qubic Governance

**📋 Proposal Type:** Incubation Program  
**⏱️ Expected Duration:** 3 months  
**💰 Total Budget:** 9.427€ ($10.370)  
**👥 Team:** MDC  
**📂 Category:** Community Tools  

## 📝 Abstract
This proposal addresses critical gaps in Qubic's governance ecosystem: language barriers that limit global participation, limited access to proposal history, and insufficient visibility into computor voting patterns. The Qubic Proposal Viewer will provide a comprehensive web platform featuring real-time proposal translations, extended historical archives, and transparent computor voting analytics.

## 💡 Motivation
The Qubic network faces governance challenges that affect community participation:

1. **🌍 Language Barriers**: A significant portion of Qubic's global community are non-native English speakers, yet proposals remain predominantly in English, limiting their ability to participate meaningfully.

2. **📚 Limited Historical Access**: While current proposals are available on the official website for 10 epochs, older proposals become inaccessible, making it difficult to track long-term decision patterns and learn from past governance.

3. **🗳️ Limited Voting Visibility**: Computor voting patterns and real-time proposal status are not easily visible, making it challenging for the community to understand voting trends and current proposal outcomes.

## 🛠️ Solution
The Qubic Proposal Viewer is a comprehensive web platform that solves these issues through:

### 🌐 Multilingual Access
- **Full Proposal Translations**: Complete translations of all proposals into 13 languages (German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Turkish, Vietnamese)
- **Real-time Translation**: New proposals are translated within minutes of submission
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Translations consider context and technical terminology

### 📚 Extended Historical Archive
- **Complete Proposal Database**: All proposals from Qubic's history in one searchable platform
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by epoch, status, author, or keywords
- **Historical Context**: Easy access to proposals beyond the 10-epoch limit of the official site

### 🗳️ Computor Voting Transparency
- **Live Voting Display**: Real-time tracking of current proposal voting status
- **Quorum Monitoring**: Clear indicators showing if proposals are meeting quorum requirements
- **Outcome Prediction**: Real-time display of whether proposals are currently passing or failing
- **Voting Pattern History**: Tracking of how individual computors vote across different proposals

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation
The platform will be built on a modern web stack with:
- **React Frontend**: Responsive design accessible on all devices
- **Node.js Backend**: Scalable API architecture
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable data storage for proposals and voting history
- **Translation Engine**: AI-powered translation with quality assurance
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Live feeds from Qubic voting systems
- **Advanced Search**: Fast, relevant search across all historical data

*Note: This project builds upon existing community-developed infrastructure for proposal monitoring, adapting and expanding it for web accessibility.*

## 🚀 Innovative Approach
- **Extended Historical Access**: Preserves Qubic governance history beyond current limits
- **Real-time Voting Transparency**: Live insights into proposal status and computor participation
- **True Global Accessibility**: Comprehensive multilingual support for diverse community
- **Community-First Design**: Built specifically for Qubic's unique governance model
